# Lazy-boy: A hotkey project for [League of Legends]

### Introduction

Lazy-boy borrows heavily from [The Core - Advanced Keyboard Layout] project for Starcraft 2. This project has similar core objectives and steals the idea of using the opposite side of the keyboard to the default key binding. This layout is currently only available for right handed players.

This layout requires a wider desktop space as the keyboard is shifted half it's length to the left and rotated. For this layout to work as intended all keys between the right hand side `Alt` and the right hand side `Ctrl` keys need to be removed (i.e. Windows, Menu).

### Considerations

* An anchored hand will provide better accuracy than a floating hand
* A bridged finger can press a key more firmly than a flat finger
* A bridged finger has better accuracy than a flat finger
* The resting position of each finger does not create a straight line
* The thumb has better range of motion and dexterity
* Keys `F` and `J` provide tactile feedback to determine location on the keyboard
* Keys `Ctrl`, `Alt` and `Shift` provide modifiers 
* As distance increases from the home key, accuracy of the finger will decrease
* As distance increases from the home key, time between keystrokes will decrease
* Alternating fingers increases actions per minute (apm)
* The more fingers in use, the higher the apm

* It is easier to perform a keystroke than to click on an object in game
* Grouping similar commands will increase learning and produce better results
* Regular combinations and situational commands should be easy to execute consecutively

### Getting started and core concepts

The first thing to note about this keyboard layout is that the keys between the `Alt` and `Ctrl` keys on the right hand side of the keyboard need to be removed and the keyboard is rotated 20-30° clockwise.

# NOTES
As the fingers are of different length, at rest, the fingers tips do not create a straight line perpendicular to the wrist. In order for the little finger to comfortably reach the `Q` key (while the other fingers are on `W`, `E`, and `R`) either the wrist (or keyboard) must be rotated roughly 25° or the finger will need to stretch.



### Principles

* Utilization of modifiers
* Home position of hand should be aligned with natural resting shape
* Minimize reaching where possible
* Utilize alteration where possible
* Utilize thumb
